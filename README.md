Now for my class project: 
This Python script allows users to retrieve information about specific classes, such as room number, instructor, and meeting time.
When you run the script.
Enter the class name when prompted.

Data Structure:
room_numbers: A dictionary mapping course codes to room numbers.
instructors: A dictionary mapping course codes to instructors' names.
meeting_times: A dictionary mapping course codes to meeting times.

Example:
Enter a class name: CS101
Output:
Class: CS101
Room: 3004
Instructor: Haynes
Time: 8:00am

If the class name entered is not found in the system, it will display "Class not found."
